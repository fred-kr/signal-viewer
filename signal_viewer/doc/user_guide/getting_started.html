        <h2>Loading Data</h2>

        <p>
            To start working with the tool, use the <i>Open File</i> button from the <a href="../ui_components/main_window.html#file-menu">File</a> menu or the <a href="../ui_components/main_window.html#tool-bar">Tool Bar</a>.
            Use the dialog window that appears to select a file to open.
            <br/>
            The following file types are currently supported:
            <ul>
                <li>European Data Format (.edf)</li>
                <li>Excel Worksheet (.xlsx, .xls)</li>
                <li>Arrow IPC / Feather v2 (.feather)</li>
                <li>Plain Text (.csv, .txt, .tsv)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            After opening a file, you need to set the signal data source (i.e. the column / channel / etc in the file
            that contains the signal values) as well as the sampling rate of the signal.
            <br/>
            A supplementary data source that should be included when computing results (e.g. temperature or
            O2-saturation recordings) can also be specified via the "Additional Data" field.
            <br/>
            Once valid values have been set, pressing the <i>Load Data</i> button will read the specified data from the
            file and load it into the tool. A table of the loaded data will be displayed in the "Data View" section of
            the <a href="../ui_components/page_input.html">Input Data</a> page.

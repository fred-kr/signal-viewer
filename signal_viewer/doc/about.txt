The `SignalViewer` tool was created to speed up the visualization, cleaning and analysis process for large records of
physiological signal data acquired from marine crabs. It is written in Python and uses PySide6 for the GUI, along with
multiple other libraries for cleaning and analysis of signal data. More information can be found through the in-app help
system.

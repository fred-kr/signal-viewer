# TODO

- [x] replace `qfluentwidgets.NavigationInterface` with `QtWidgets.QTabWidget`
- [ ] add functionality to load annotations from separate file
- [ ] look into reimplementing neurokit2 functions for filtering and peak detection to remove dependency on neurokit2 package
- [ ] documentation
- [ ] find alternative way of highlighting input widgets besides setting a custom stylesheet since doing that replaces any existing style and overwrites any inherited styles
